# XFGenerateBarcodeSample

Sample code for scanning barcodes with ZXing and Xamarin.Forms for my video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkub8wWf6HA&list=PLfbOp004UaYUgjhTHjtSixo-iMdz6PhIv&index=1

Made a version where generated QR code can be edited on the same screen. This can be handy to copypaste information into the generated QR code that then can be read by any device from the sceen. For example to copypaste text from Android to IOS.
